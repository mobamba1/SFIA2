	<h3>Welcome to battleships!!</h3>
	<p>An enemy ship has been spotted on the south coast of Miami beach.</p>
	<p>Unfortunatly they are using an advance camouflage system and we cannot pinpoint their location.</p>
	<p>Our only option now is to shoot randomly and pray that we hit them!</p>
	<p>When ready press the fire button!</p>
